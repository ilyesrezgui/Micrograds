# Micrograds
This repo contains two implementations of micrograd One in java and the other in python. A system for calculating backpropagation for a small neural netword or acyclic oriented graph. 
We keep track of the nodes using the topological sort algorithm.

For the python implmentation, I have added a UI in streamlit for visualizing the graph before and after performing backpropagation. that way you can keep track of the grads of each node.
